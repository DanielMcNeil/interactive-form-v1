# Interactive Form V1
Full stack javascript techdegree project 3

JavaScript validated with JSHint

HTML and CSS validated with W3C validator

Checked for cross browser comptability with Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and IE 11

**Note:** 
After reading the article about email validation with regular expressions I decided to use the HTML 5 default (type="email" on the input) 
because I believe that anything beyond that is overkill.  People will always find a way to enter a wrong email no matter what you do.

Also, I really wish the W3C would mandate that select boxes and dropdowns be able to be styled with CSS.  Having to use a jQuery plugin, 
and then compensate for all of the undesired visual artifacts, is a major pain!
